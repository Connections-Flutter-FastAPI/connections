# [Your App Name - e.g., Connections] Community Guidelines

**_Effective Date: [Date - e.g., September 1, 2024]_**

Welcome to the [Your App Name] community! Our goal is to create a positive, engaging, and safe environment for everyone to connect around shared interests and locations. These Community Guidelines outline the standards of behavior expected from all users. They apply to all content and interactions within the Service, including posts, replies, chat messages, events, communities, and profiles.

Failure to follow these guidelines may result in content removal, warnings, account suspension, or permanent banning from the Service.

## 1. Be Respectful

*   **Treat others with kindness and respect,** even if you disagree. Healthy debate is okay; personal attacks, insults, and harassment are not.
*   **No Hate Speech or Discrimination:** Content that promotes violence, discrimination, or hatred against individuals or groups based on attributes like race, ethnicity, religion, gender identity, sexual orientation, disability, or national origin is strictly prohibited.
*   **No Bullying or Harassment:** Do not engage in targeted harassment, intimidation, or bullying of other users.

## 2. Keep it Safe

*   **No Illegal Activities:** Do not promote, organize, or engage in any illegal activities using the Service.
*   **No Dangerous Content:** Do not share content that promotes dangerous acts, self-harm, or eating disorders. If you or someone you know needs help, please seek professional assistance or contact emergency services.
*   **No Graphic Violence or Gore:** Avoid posting excessively graphic or shocking content.
*   **Protect Minors:** Content that exploits or endangers children is forbidden and will be reported to authorities.

## 3. Be Authentic

*   **No Impersonation:** Do not impersonate other individuals, brands, or organizations in a misleading way. Parody accounts should be clearly marked.
*   **No Spam or Manipulation:** Do not post repetitive, unwanted content, engage in vote manipulation, or use deceptive practices to artificially inflate engagement or visibility.

## 4. Respect Privacy

*   **Do Not Share Private Information:** Avoid sharing someone else's private information (like phone numbers, addresses, private photos/videos) without their explicit consent.

## 5. Content Standards

*   **Nudity and Sexual Content:** Sexually explicit content, non-consensual sexual content, and content involving the sexualization of minors are strictly prohibited. Nudity may be allowed in specific contexts (e.g., artistic, educational) but is generally restricted.
*   **Intellectual Property:** Respect copyright and trademark laws. Only share content that you have the right to share.

## 6. Enforcement

We use a combination of automated systems and human review to enforce these guidelines. Actions we may take include:
*   Removing violating content.
*   Issuing warnings to users.
*   Temporarily suspending accounts.
*   Permanently banning accounts for severe or repeat violations.

## 7. Reporting Violations

If you encounter content or behavior that violates these guidelines, please use the reporting tools available within the app (e.g., on posts, replies, profiles) or contact us via the "Report a Problem" link in the Help & Support section. Provide as much detail as possible.

## 8. Guideline Updates

These guidelines may evolve as our community grows and changes. We will update them as needed and encourage you to review them periodically.

Thank you for helping make [Your App Name] a welcoming and vibrant community!
